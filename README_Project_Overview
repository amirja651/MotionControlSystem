# ESP32 High-Precision Motion Control System

## Project Overview

### System Architecture

The ESP32 High-Precision Motion Control System is a sophisticated motion control framework designed for ultra-precise multi-axis positioning applications, particularly suited for laser alignment and precision instrumentation. The system leverages the ESP32's dual-core architecture to achieve real-time performance and high reliability.

#### Key Architectural Layers

1. **Application Layer**

   - `Configuration.h`: Global system-wide configuration
   - `main.cpp`: Entry point and multi-core task distribution

2. **Control Layer**
   - `MotorManager`: Manages multiple motors
   - `Motor`: Individual motor control abstraction
   - `PIDController`: Advanced closed-loop control algorithm
   - `TrajectoryPlanner`: Generates smooth motion profiles
   - `SafetyMonitor`: Comprehensive system safety monitoring

3. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**
   - `DriverInterface`: Abstract driver for different motor types
   - `StepperDriver`: Stepper motor control implementation
   - `Encoder`: High-resolution position feedback
   - `GPIOManager`: Pin management and allocation
   - `TimerManager`: Precise hardware timing control

4. **Utility Layer**
   - `TaskScheduler`: Real-time task management
   - `CircularBuffer`: Efficient data buffering
   - `EEPROMManager`: Persistent configuration storage
   - `Logger`: Diagnostic logging system
   - `MathUtils`: Optimized mathematical functions

5. **Communication Layer**
   - `SerialCommand`: Text-based command interface
   - `CommandProtocol`: Binary communication protocol
   - `StatusReporter`: System status reporting
